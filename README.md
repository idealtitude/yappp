# YAP++

**yap** is an html preprocessor written in Python; **yap++** is a tentative to write it in C++... You can find the former at [github.com/idealtitude/yap](https://github.com/idealtitude/yap).

yap indeed stands for Yet Another -html- Preprocessor, and as the verb “to yap” means barking, you'll easily find that it's a reference to Pug, the famous HTML Preprocessor.
